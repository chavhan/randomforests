Development Environment:
My script was developed RStudio Version 1.3.1056

Usage:
Install RStudio. Open file in RStudio and change the code according to you dataset for various situations and run it.


File Description 
random_forest_company- file in R language covering objective of company dataset
company_analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on company dataset
random_forest_fraudCheck- file in R language covering objective of fraud dataset
fraud_analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on fraud dataset
random_forest_iris- file in R language covering objective of by default dataset iris
iris_analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on iris dataset
total_result - It is an set of results of accuracy figure on company/fraud/iris dataset 



objective:- 
(1) company dataset - A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the segment or attributes causes high sale. 
(2) Fraud dataset - Use decision trees to prepare a model on fraud data, treating those who have taxable_income <= 30000 as "Risky" and others are "Good"
(3) iris dataset- Build a random forest for the ‘iris’ data. 

Note :- I have added some png files which are the different graphs on both the datasets for EDA and result observation purpose. Also added the snapshot dataset.
